Testing

In software development, testing refers to the process of evaluating the software to identify defects, errors, or other issues that could impact its quality or performance.

Testing is a critical component of the software development lifecycle, as it helps to ensure that the software meets the requirements and specifications that have been defined, and that it functions as intended.

The main goal of testing is to identify defects or errors in the software, so that they can be corrected before the software is released to the end users. 

Testing can help to identify issues such as bugs, usability problems, security vulnerabilities, and performance issues, among others.

Testing can be conducted at various stages of the software development lifecycle, including during development, after the software has been completed, and during maintenance and updates. 

Testing can be performed using a variety of techniques, including manual testing, automated testing, and exploratory testing.


There are various types of testing that can be performed in software development. Here are some of the most common types of testing:

	Unit Testing:

--------------------------------------------------
Testing principles:

Testing principles are fundamental guidelines and beliefs that shape the approach and mindset of testers when conducting software testing. These principles help testers to design effective test strategies, prioritize testing activities, and make informed decisions throughout the testing process. 

1. Exhaustiveness is impossible: It is practically impossible to test all possible combinations and scenarios due to the complexity of modern software systems. Testers should aim to achieve an acceptable level of test coverage while understanding that complete coverage is unattainable.


2. Early testing: Testing activities should be initiated as early as possible in the software development lifecycle. Identifying defects early helps in reducing the cost and effort required for fixing them later in the process.

3. Defect clustering: A small number of modules or functionalities often contain the majority of defects. By focusing testing efforts on these high-risk areas, testers can maximize the effectiveness of their testing efforts.

4. Pesticide paradox: Repeating the same set of tests over time may lead to a decrease in their effectiveness as they become less likely to discover new defects. Testers should regularly review and update their test suites (group of test cases) to ensure test cases remain relevant and effective.

5. Testing is context-dependent: Testing approaches and techniques should be tailored to the specific context of the software being tested. The nature of the application, its purpose, technology stack, and user expectations should all be considered when designing the testing strategy.

6. Absence-of-errors fallacy: The absence of errors in a software system does not imply that it is defect-free. Testing can increase confidence in the software's quality, but it cannot guarantee its perfection. Testers should provide information about the risks associated with the system, even if no defects have been found.

7. Testers' independence: Testers should maintain independence from the development process and have a separate perspective. This independence helps to identify potential biases and ensures that a fresh, objective viewpoint is brought to the testing process.

8. Continuous testing: Testing should be an ongoing and iterative process, integrated into the software development lifecycle. Regular testing iterations allow for early detection and resolution of issues, facilitating faster delivery of high-quality software.

These principles are not exhaustive, and there may be additional principles depending on the testing context and methodology used. However, understanding and applying these principles can guide testers in making informed decisions and improving the effectiveness of their testing efforts.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Quality Engineering:

Quality engineering is a holistic approach to ensure and improve the quality of software products or systems throughout the entire software development lifecycle. It goes beyond traditional software testing and encompasses various activities and practices aimed at delivering high-quality software. Quality engineering focuses on preventing defects rather than just detecting them, and it emphasizes the collaboration and involvement of all stakeholders in the software development process.

Here are some key aspects and practices associated with quality engineering:

1. Quality mindset: Quality engineering promotes a shift in mindset where everyone involved in the software development process takes responsibility for the quality of the product. Quality becomes a shared goal, and all team members strive to deliver a high-quality end result.

2. Requirements engineering: Quality engineering emphasizes the importance of clearly understanding and defining requirements. It involves close collaboration between stakeholders to gather, analyze, validate, and prioritize requirements to ensure that they are complete, consistent, and testable.

3. Test automation: Quality engineering leverages test automation to increase efficiency, effectiveness, and repeatability of tests. Automated tests are designed to validate software functionality, performance, and reliability, allowing for quick and accurate regression testing and enabling faster feedback on software quality.

4. Continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD): Quality engineering integrates testing and quality assurance activities into the CI/CD pipeline. This ensures that software changes are continuously tested, integrated, and deployed, enabling faster feedback loops and reducing the risk of introducing defects into the production environment.

5. Agile and DevOps practices: Quality engineering aligns with Agile and DevOps methodologies, promoting iterative and collaborative development processes. It emphasizes close collaboration between developers, testers, and other stakeholders, enabling faster feedback, quick response to changes, and continuous improvement of the software.

6. Metrics and measurements: Quality engineering emphasizes the collection and analysis of relevant quality metrics and measurements. This helps in tracking the progress of quality goals, identifying bottlenecks or areas for improvement, and making data-driven decisions to enhance the software development and testing process.

7. Continuous learning and improvement: Quality engineering fosters a culture of continuous learning and improvement. It encourages retrospective reviews, knowledge sharing, and the implementation of lessons learned from previous projects. Regular feedback loops and proactive identification of process improvements are essential aspects of quality engineering.

Overall, quality engineering is a proactive and collaborative approach to ensure that software products meet or exceed the expected quality standards. It involves integrating quality practices throughout the software development lifecycle, focusing on prevention rather than just detection of defects, and promoting a culture of quality within the organization.

STLC

STLC (Software Testing Life Cycle) and SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) are two important processes in software development.
The number of phases in STLC may vary depending on the organization and the project. However, typically, there are six to seven phases involved in the Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC)

SDLC is the process of designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software. It includes several phases such as planning, requirement gathering, design, coding, testing, deployment, and maintenance. The main objective of SDLC is to ensure that the software is developed according to the requirements and specifications of the client, within the budget and timeframe, and that it meets the quality standards.

On the other hand, STLC is the process of designing, planning, executing, and reporting the software testing activities. It includes several phases such as requirement analysis, test planning, test design, test execution, and test closure. The main objective of STLC is to ensure that the software is thoroughly tested and that all the defects and issues are identified and resolved before the software is deployed to production.

The following is a brief overview of the various phases involved in STLC and SDLC:

STLC:

	Requirement Analysis: 
		In this phase, the requirements and specifications of the software are analyzed to identify what needs to be tested. This includes identifying the test objectives, scope, and testable requirements.

	Test Planning: 
		In this phase, the testing strategy, test plan, and test cases are created based on the requirements and specifications gathered in the previous phase. The resources required for testing, including hardware, software, and personnel, are also identified.

	Test Case Development: 
		In this phase, the test cases are developed based on the requirements and specifications. The test cases are designed to verify that the software meets the functional and non-functional requirements, and cover all possible scenarios and edge cases.

	Test Environment Setup: 
		In this phase, the testing environment is set up, which includes hardware, software, and other tools required for testing. The test data is also prepared and loaded into the test environment.

	Test Execution: 
		In this phase, the actual testing is performed based on the test cases developed in the previous phase. The software is tested to ensure that it meets the requirements and specifications, and any defects or issues are identified and reported.

	Test Cycle Closure: 
		In this phase, the test results are analyzed, and a report is created to summarize the testing process, test results, and any issues found. The report is used to determine if the software is ready for release, or if further testing is required. Any defects or issues found during testing are reported to the development team for resolution.

SDLC:

	Planning: 
		In this phase, the project scope, objectives, timeline, budget, and resources are defined. The requirements are gathered and analyzed to determine what needs to be developed.

	Requirements Gathering: 
		In this phase, the requirements of the software are gathered from stakeholders and users. The requirements are documented and analyzed to ensure that they are complete, consistent, and testable.

	Design: 
		In this phase, the software architecture, design, and specifications are developed based on the requirements gathered in the previous phase. This includes creating detailed system and user interface designs, database design, and software component design.

	Development: 
		In this phase, the software is coded and developed according to the design specifications. This includes unit testing, code reviews, and version control to ensure that the software is of high quality.

	Testing: 
		In this phase, the software is tested to ensure that it meets the requirements and specifications. This includes unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing.

	Deployment: 
		In this phase, the software is deployed to the production environment. This includes preparing the installation packages, user manuals, and training materials, and performing the installation and configuration of the software.

	Maintenance: 
		In this phase, the software is maintained and updated as required. This includes fixing any bugs or issues found during the testing or deployment phases, updating the software to support new features, and providing support and maintenance to end-users.
	

STLC vs SDLC: How Do They Differ?

Although both are related to software development, with overlapping timelines, Software Development Life Cycle and Software Testing Life Cycle follow different goals and guidelines. 
STLC can be performed as a series of steps within the SDLC cycle or can be performed alongside SDLC phases. 

The primary difference is that SDLC is responsible for collecting requirements and creating features accordingly. 
Meanwhile, STLC is responsible for creating tests adapted to the collected requirements and for verifying that features meet those requirements. 
If the SDLC created features that do more than necessary, it’s often okay, however, if STLC tests do more than necessary an unnecessary burden is placed on the team. 

Both life cycles require the cooperation of stakeholders, DevOps, and testing teams. 
Without this cooperation, you cannot verify that requirements are properly defined, that tests are relevant, or that results are applied properly.

Purpose: The SDLC is a structured framework for developing software, while the STLC is a structured framework for testing software.

Focus: The SDLC focuses on the overall development process, from planning to deployment and maintenance, while the STLC focuses specifically on the testing process, from planning to execution and reporting.

Activities: The SDLC includes activities such as requirements gathering, design, development, testing, and deployment, while the STLC includes activities such as test planning, test case development, test execution, and defect tracking.

Roles: In the SDLC, there are different roles such as project manager, business analyst, developer, and tester, while in the STLC, the focus is on the testing team, which includes test manager, test engineer, and other testing specialists.

Deliverables: The SDLC delivers the final software product, while the STLC delivers the testing results and reports.

Case study for a web application that allows users to search for and book flights using the STLC process:

Requirement Analysis Phase:
The testing team reviewed the requirements of the web application and identified the testable requirements. The requirements included the ability to search for flights based on criteria such as departure location, arrival location, date, and time. Users should be able to view available flights, select a flight, and book the flight by providing their personal and payment information.

	The first step in STLC is to analyze the requirements for the application. For this web application, the requirements may include:
	The ability for users to search for flights based on the destination, date, and number of passengers.
	The ability for users to filter flights based on price, airlines, and departure/arrival times.
	The ability for users to book flights and pay online.
	The ability to send confirmation emails to users after booking flights.
	The ability to manage flight schedules and availability on the back-end.
	A search function that allows users to search for flights based on departure and arrival locations, dates, and other criteria.
	A booking system that allows users to book flights and make payments online.
	An account management system that allows users to create accounts, view their booking history, and manage their personal information.
	A notification system that sends users reminders about upcoming flights and updates on their bookings.
	

Test Planning Phase:
The testing team created a detailed test plan that included the scope of testing, testing objectives, test deliverables, and the timeline for testing. The team identified the testing environment, resources, and tools required for testing.

	Once the requirements are analyzed, the testing team creates a detailed testing plan. This plan includes:
	The scope of testing, including the features and functionalities that will be tested.
