Hooks in React:

Hooks are the new feature introduced in the React 16.8 version. It allows you to use state and other React features without writing a class. Hooks are the functions which "hook into" React state and lifecycle features from function components.

useState:

Use useState to manage state in functional components without using class components.
It returns an array with the current state value and a function to update it.
Each call to useState corresponds to a single piece of state.
When using objects or arrays as state, make sure to spread the previous state to avoid overwriting.


useEffect:

useEffect is used for handling side effects (doing something extra which is not part of react component) in functional components.
It replaces lifecycle methods like componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount.
You can have multiple useEffect hooks in a single component.
Use the dependency array as the second argument to specify when the effect should run based on changes to dependencies.
If the dependency array is empty, the effect runs only after the initial render.


useContext:

useContext allows functional components to access context values without wrapping in a higher-order component.
It's useful for sharing data that needs to be accessed by many components.
You need to pass a context object created with React.createContext() to the hook.


useReducer:

useReducer is an alternative to useState for managing more complex state logic.
It accepts a reducer function and an initial state, returns the current state and a dispatch function.
Dispatch functions send actions to the reducer, which specifies how the state should change based on the action type.


useMemo:

useMemo memoizes the result of a function so it's not recomputed unless its dependencies change.
It's useful for optimizing expensive calculations or avoiding unnecessary re-renders.
Only use useMemo when you need to optimize performance, as it adds complexity.


useCallback:

useCallback memoizes functions to prevent re-creation of the function reference across renders.
It's beneficial when passing callbacks as props to child components to avoid unnecessary re-renders.
Just like with useMemo, use useCallback when you need to optimize performance.


useRef:

useRef returns a mutable ref object that persists across renders and does not trigger re-renders.
It's often used for accessing DOM elements directly, managing focus, or persisting values.

Formik and Yup are two popular libraries in the React ecosystem that work together to simplify the process of building and validating forms. They provide a powerful combination for managing form state and performing validation in React applications.

Formik:

Formik is a library that helps you manage form state, form submission, and form-related functions in a more organized and efficient manner.
It provides a higher-level abstraction for handling form-related operations, reducing boilerplate code.
Formik manages form values, validation, submission, touched fields, and error messages.
It works well with both controlled and uncontrolled components.
Formik makes it easy to handle asynchronous form submission and submission status.


Yup:

Yup is a library for schema validation, particularly focused on validating JavaScript objects and form values.
It allows you to define validation schemas using a simple and expressive API.
Yup supports various types of validation, including string validation, number validation, date validation, and more.
It integrates seamlessly with Formik to perform validation on form values.
Yup provides localization support, allowing you to customize error messages based on the user's locale.
The combination of Formik and Yup is often used to create robust and user-friendly forms in React applications:
