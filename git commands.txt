Process of git clone and push
---------------------------------
go to gitlab.stackroute.in

create a new project (linux-ex)

git clone url (it will clone the cloud repo in your local system)

go to the folder
add a new file -> linux.txt

mkdir - create a new folder
ls - list of the folder

save the file

git status (it will check and compare your cloud repo with your local folder)
git add . (it will add the untracked files to the cloud repo but it will not push)
git commit -m "first commit" (commit your changes to the cloud repo with the message)
git push origin master (push command will finally push your files to the cloud repo. Origin is the url)
git remote show origin (your local git repo is connected with which cloud repo)


Process of git init and push
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There should be a way of converting a folder into a git repository
rather than doing git clone and creating a new folder

go inside the folder which you want to convert into a git repo
open cmd over there

1. create a new project on gitlab - git-demo-2
2. come to your file explorer -> create a folder -> add some file -> save the file
3. go inside that folder -> open cmd

git init (this folder is now a git repository)
git remote add origin https://gitlab.stackroute.in/Payal/12-july-session-notes.git

git remote show origin

git status (it will check and compare your cloud repo with your local folder)
git add . (it will add the untracked files to the cloud repo but it will not push)
git commit -m "first commit" (commit your changes to the cloud repo with the message)
git push origin master (push command will finally push your files to the cloud repo. Origin is the url)
git remote show origin (your local git repo is connected with which cloud repo)
